2.Authentication: Supports user authentication via credentials provided securely.

3.Email Retrieval: Fetches emails based on user-defined filters like sender's email address, subject keywords, or time period.

4.Data Parsing: Parses retrieved emails into structured data (e.g., sender, subject, body, attachments) for further processing.

5.Error Handling: Includes robust error handling for network issues, authentication failures, and other potential errors.

6.User Interface: Offers a command-line or graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction and input.
